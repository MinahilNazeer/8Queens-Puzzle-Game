# 8Queens-Puzzle-Game

## Project Description
The **8 Queens Puzzle Game** is a web-based logic game where you place 8 queens on a chessboard so that none can attack each other (no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).  

This project was built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to practice my JavaScript skills and strengthen my logic-building abilities. It also helped me understand the algorithm for placing queens safely, which I studied in **Artificial Intelligence**(My course subject).


## Why I Created This Project
- To **practice JavaScript** in a hands-on way.  
- To understand the **algorithmic logic** behind the 8 Queens problem.  
- To improve **front-end skills** by designing a clean, minimalistic UI.  
- To explore **DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic updates** in real-time.


##  Challenges Faced
Creating this game wasn’t straightforward. Some challenges included:  
- Figuring out the **algorithm to calculate rows, columns, and diagonals** for danger zones.  
- Designing the board **minimalistically** while keeping it interactive and visually appealing.  
- Thinking about **future improvements**, like animations or building it in React for smoother UI.  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – for the structure of the game  
- **CSS** – for styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – for game logic, DOM manipulation, and dynamic updates
